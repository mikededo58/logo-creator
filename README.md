## Logo Creator

#Descrption

I was set out to make a svg generator, the goal is to leverage inquirer to prompt questions and then use class constructors to make the logo. We also are leveraging jest to test our shapes and make sure they are rendering the correct shapes. This project was challenging as this was the the first time using OOP as well as testing. Making sure you have all of your modules set up correctly was new for me. It was also challenging to figure out how to test with multiple classes being leveraged.

#Install
The user will need to install inquirer@8.2.4 as well jest for this project.
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
npm i jest

#Usage
To use this project you will need to run node index.js and answer a series of questions in the propmt. You can then access the file in the examples folder.
To test this project you will need to run npm test and it will kick off jest.
